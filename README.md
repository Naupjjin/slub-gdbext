# slub-gdbext
**slub-gdbext** is a GDB extension for debugging the SLUB allocator.  
This extension is based on the `slab_caches` address and some structure offsets (Default offset for kernel 6.15.7.).  
By using these addresses, you can retrieve more information about the SLUB allocator.
Additionally, implement commands that simplify kernel debugging in QEMU â€” for example, by interacting with the QEMU monitor through a socket.

## Why make this ext?
This extension works without requiring full debug symbols and supports systems with SLUB protections enabled.
